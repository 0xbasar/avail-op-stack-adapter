# Types
[Git Source](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/f7b73857601914eeea6fc4c1ba46ae99ca744d97/contracts/libraries/Types.sol)

Contains various types used throughout the Optimism contract system.


## Structs
### OutputProposal
OutputProposal represents a commitment to the L2 state. The timestamp is the L1
timestamp that the output root is posted. This timestamp is used to verify that the
finalization period has passed since the output root was submitted.


```solidity
struct OutputProposal {
    bytes32 outputRoot;
    uint128 timestamp;
    uint128 l2BlockNumber;
}
```

### OutputRootProof
Struct representing the elements that are hashed together to generate an output root
which itself represents a snapshot of the L2 state.


```solidity
struct OutputRootProof {
    bytes32 version;
    bytes32 stateRoot;
    bytes32 messagePasserStorageRoot;
    bytes32 latestBlockhash;
}
```

### UserDepositTransaction
Struct representing a deposit transaction (L1 => L2 transaction) created by an end
user (as opposed to a system deposit transaction generated by the system).


```solidity
struct UserDepositTransaction {
    address from;
    address to;
    bool isCreation;
    uint256 value;
    uint256 mint;
    uint64 gasLimit;
    bytes data;
    bytes32 l1BlockHash;
    uint256 logIndex;
}
```

### WithdrawalTransaction
Struct representing a withdrawal transaction.


```solidity
struct WithdrawalTransaction {
    uint256 nonce;
    address sender;
    address target;
    uint256 value;
    uint256 gasLimit;
    bytes data;
}
```
