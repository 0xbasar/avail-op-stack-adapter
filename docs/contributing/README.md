## Contributing Documentation

Welcome! In this directory, we attempt to provide extensive documentation
on how to best contribute to the Optimism Monorepo.

The contributing documents are laid out like so.

- [`quickstart`](./quickstart.md): Setting up your development environment.
- [`labels`](./labels.md): Monorepo labels and how they're used.
- [`pull-request`](./pull-requests.md): Processes around pull requests.

Overall, there are many ways to contribute. In particular we appreciate
support in the following areas:

- Reporting issues. For security issues see [Security policy][security].
- Fixing and responding to existing issues. To start, view issues tagged with ["good first issue"][first] which are meant as introductory issues for external contributors.
- Improving the [community site][community], [documentation][documentation] and [tutorials][tutorials].
- Become an "Optimizer" and answer questions in the [Optimism Discord][discord].
- Get involved in the protocol design process by proposing changes or new features or write parts of the spec yourself in the [specs subdirectory](./specs/).

We follow the rule that **no contribution is too small** and all contributions are valuable.

Note that we have a [Code of Conduct][conduct], please follow it in all your interactions with the project.
